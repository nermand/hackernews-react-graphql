# Hackernews clone with React and GraphQL (Apollo Client)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running the app

Run the following command, both in `src/` and `src/server/` folders:

### `npm start`

That will start the React app on the port *3000* which will consume Node.js powered backend code running on the port *4000*.
